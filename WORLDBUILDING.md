# Worldbuilding & Theme Exploration

Exploring cohesive naming through worldbuilding (post-NAMING.md clarity pivot).

## Why This Matters

**Naming is manipulation (the good kind).**

When people encounter your tools, the names create expectations:
- **Corporate names** (normalize, interconnect, DataPipeline) → "this is serious production software, I need expertise, this scales to billions"
- **Cozy names** (bubbletea, lipgloss, uxn) → "this is approachable, made by humans, I can try this casually"

The worldbuilding creates a **conceptual space**. If that space is cozy/collaborative/playful, people bring that energy. If it's corporate/technical/serious, they bring different energy.

**We want people to approach our tools with:**
- "This feels approachable, I can try it"
- "It's okay if I start small and imperfect"
- "This is made with care for humans"
- "This respects my time and doesn't demand expertise"

Not:
- "I need to read extensive docs first"
- "This is for serious production use only"
- "I should optimize and scale from day one"

**Our vision** (see docs/problems.md):
- Creation as play, not work
- First step trivially easy
- Permission to be imperfect
- Real connection (symmetric, not parasocial)
- Calm, respectful software
- Local-first, network-capable
- Collaboration should be natural (like games)
- Anti-corporate, anti-extraction, anti-metrics

If our names embody this vision, people *feel* it before reading any manifesto.

## Context

After pivoting from botanical names to clarity-focused names (see NAMING.md), we're evaluating whether our names have lost personality and become too generic/corporate.

**Current evaluation:**
- Some names work (dew, moonlet, habitat, concord, playmate)
- Some feel too corporate/enterprise (normalize, interconnect, reformer)
- Some feel too scientific (polymorphine/manyfold, polarizer)
- Overall: **no cohesive theme** - we have 8+ different semantic domains

## Desired Aesthetic

**Target vibe: pastel/tumblr/small web**

### Prior Art

**100 Rabbits (uxn ecosystem)**
- uxn, varvara, orca, left, nasu, pilot, ronin
- Simple words (4-6 letters), often lowercase
- Proper nouns or repurposed common words
- Human-scale, handmade feeling
- Permacomputing/solarpunk/smol tech
- Nothing corporate, nothing enterprise

**Sokpop Collective**
- simmiland, clutterbox, pipo park, badru, coiltackle, helkube
- Playful compounds or made-up names
- Lowercase cozy vibes
- Indie game/toy aesthetic
- "Made by small team in a weekend" energy
- Slightly nonsensical but charming

**Charm Bracelet**
- bubbletea, lipgloss, glamour, glow, bubbles, gum, pop, melt, soft-serve
- Delightful confections/aesthetics theme
- Short, fun, memorable
- Playful but professional
- Cohesive aesthetic without rigid taxonomy

**Tailwags**
- wag, bark, fetch, paws - dog/puppy domain
- Cute, playful, pastel, modern small-web
- Perfect vibe reference but they own the puppy space
- We want similar energy, different semantic territory

### Aesthetic: "Fluffy Pastel"

**Not:**
- Digital desktop vibes (too tech-forward)
- Vibrant/boisterous (too loud)
- Corporate/industrial (wrong energy entirely)

**Yes:**
- Fluffy/plushie soft (soft-shaded art, no harsh outlines)
- Pastel colors (fairy floss, kandi bracelets, gentle)
- Childlike wonder (not childish)
- Small-scale, intimate
- Gentle/hushed (not boisterous)
- Whimsical but calm
- Muted pastels
- Creative but unhurried

**References:**
- Needy Streamer Overload, Unpacking, Melatonin (soft digital life)
- Pastel pop, hyperpop aesthetics
- Kandi raver PLUR positivity
- Yaelokre "Harpy Hare" (small forest folk tale vibes)
- Soft treats (bubbletea, soft-serve)

### Name Characteristics

- Simple/short (4-7 letters ideal)
- Often lowercase in presentation
- Could be: real words repurposed, gentle compounds, soft neologisms
- Handmade/indie/personal feeling
- Playful but not jokey
- Soft sounds, gentle consonants
- Anti-enterprise, anti-scale
- itch.io/neocities/tilde/permacomputing vibes

## Vision → World Constraints

What kind of world embodies our values?

**Must feel:**
- Small-scale, human-sized (not infinite/overwhelming)
- Collaborative and symmetric (not hierarchical/broadcasting)
- Playful and creative (not serious/performative)
- Calm and unhurried (not demanding/urgent)
- Welcoming of imperfection (not polished/curated)
- Made with care (not industrial/automated)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Corporate office vibes (productivity, efficiency, optimization)
- Industrial/factory (mass production, scale, pipelines)
- Laboratory (sterile, precise, scientific)
- Military/command (hierarchical, authoritative, control)

**Patterns that work:**
- Small creative communities (studios, workshops, gardens)
- Collaborative making (working together on shared artifacts)
- Exploration and discovery (not optimization)
- Tending and care (not extraction)

## Worldbuilding Approach

Instead of "pick names from a category," build a **cohesive world** where all our tools naturally exist as things/concepts in that world.

**Challenge:** What cozy/pastel world naturally contains:
- Structural code intelligence (Moss)
- Procedural generation (Resin)
- API bindings (Liana)
- Data transformation (Cambium)
- Runtime orchestration (Spore)
- Format conversion (rescribe)
- Federation protocols (Hypha)
- Object stores (Lotus)
- Expression language (Dew)
- Game primitives (Frond)
- Tool configuration (Nursery)
- Universal UI (Canopy)
- Capability interfaces (Pith)
- Legacy lifting (Siphon)
- Multi-protocol derives (Trellis)

### Theme Explorations (Pastel-Fluffy Lens)

**❌ Workshop/Studio (cottagecore, not pastel)**
- loom, kiln, press, easel, bench
- Too earthy/physical, not soft enough
- Verdict: Wrong vibe

**❌ Digital Desktop/Virtual Room**
- window, widget, cache, pixel, sprite
- Too tech-forward, synthetic not soft
- Verdict: Interesting but misses fluffy gentleness

**🤔 Sweet Treats / Confections** (Charm Bracelet model)
- fizz, sprinkle, mochi, taffy, sherbet, sorbet, glaze
- ✅ Pastel-coded, sweet, gentle
- ❌ Encroaches on Charm's territory
- ❌ Might feel too sugary/surface
- Verdict: Right vibe but maybe derivative

**✅ Small Soft Things**
- bell, chime, ribbon, feather, petal, wisp, tuft
- ✅ Tactile, delicate, gentle
- ✅ Fluffy/plushie energy
- Verdict: Valid direction

**✅ Soft Sounds / Onomatopoeia**
- hum, murmur, chirp, tinkle, plink, whoosh, flutter
- ✅ Cute, playful, alive
- ✅ Gentle consonants, soft sounds
- Verdict: Valid direction

**✅ Weather/Atmosphere (soft phenomena)**
- mist, dew, haze, drift, breeze, drizzle, shimmer
- ✅ Ambient, calming, pastel-friendly
- ✅ Gentle, atmospheric
- Verdict: Valid direction

**❌ Toys/Playthings**
- block, marble, crayon, spinner, puzzle
- Too vibrant/boisterous
- Verdict: Wrong energy

**❌ Sleep/Dreams**
- dream, doze, nap, snooze, lull
- Too restful - doesn't inspire creativity
- Verdict: Too sleepy

## Current Names - Vibe Check

### ✅ Fits pastel/small-web aesthetic:
- **dew** - perfect
- **zone** - if lowercase, yes
- **rescribe** - handmade, soft

### 🤔 Could work with presentation:
- **habitat** - real word, soft
- **moonlet** - playful
- **concord** - simple word
- **playmate** - friendly

### ❌ Wrong vibe (too corporate/technical):
- **normalize** - AWS service
- **interconnect** - Cisco enterprise
- **reformer** - too serious
- **polymorphine/manyfold** - academic
- **typedrc** - too technical
- **polarizer** - science equipment
- **resurrect** - too theatrical
- **portals** - borderline, depends on world

## Leading Direction: Small Woodland Whispers 🍄

**The world:** Intimate small forest. Not grand wilderness - a gentle woodland glade. Small creatures, soft phenomena, folk tale magic. Harpy Hare / Yaelokre coded.

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Fluffy/soft aesthetic (moths, down, moss)
- ✅ Gentle/hushed (whispers, rustles, murmurs)
- ✅ Small-scale, intimate
- ✅ Whimsical but calm
- ✅ Nature as break from technology ("touch grass" energy)
- ✅ Pastel-friendly (muted forest colors, dusk light)
- ✅ Rhizome (underground network) fits perfectly
- ✅ Creative but unhurried (natural growth, seasonal time)

**Combining three sub-themes:**

### 🦋 Small Forest Creatures/Elements
- moth, fern, moss, acorn, twig, lichen, spore
- Gentle, small-scale nature
- Lives in the understory, not the canopy

### 🌫️ Soft Phenomena (weather/light/sound)
- wisp, rustle, flutter, murmur, shimmer, haze, glow, glimmer
- Atmospheric, ambient
- Gentle movements and sounds

### 🧶 Soft Textures/Materials
- velvet, down, fleece, fluff, tuft, felt, cotton
- Plushie-coded, tactile softness
- Fluffy energy

**Example names from this world:**
moth, fern, wisp, rustle, flutter, murmur, velvet, down, shimmer, haze, glow, moss, dusk, mist

**Aesthetic references:**
- Yaelokre "Harpy Hare" (small forest folk tales)
- Sable (pastel desert, soft art, gentle exploration)
- Feather (peaceful bird flying, pastel skies, no objectives)
- Ori (soft-shaded forest, gentle light, magical)
- Journey (pastel desert, flowing cloth, calm)
- Ghibli forests (soft light, magical, pastel)

**Key insight:** Pastel + nature works! Pick elements that are ALREADY soft/pastel/fluffy:
- ✅ sakura, petal, mist, moth, shimmer, wisp, dusk, dawn (inherently soft)
- ❌ bark, timber, root, branch (too earthy/rugged)

**The vibe:** Soft, hushed, intimate, whimsical-but-calm, gentle exploration, nature as respite, permission to be small and gentle. Pastel-magical-nature, not dark-wild-forest.

## Next Steps

1. Map each project to the Small Woodland Whispers world
2. Find specific names from the three sub-themes:
   - Small forest creatures/elements (moth, fern, moss, acorn)
   - Soft phenomena (wisp, rustle, flutter, murmur, shimmer)
   - Soft textures (velvet, down, fluff, tuft)
3. Check crates.io availability
4. Test names against vision values (approachable, playful, calm)
5. Consider: some current names might already fit (dew!)
6. Keep NAMING.md as historical reference

## Open Questions

- Is "small woodland whispers" too nature/cottagecore vs pastel-digital?
- Should we lean more into bright pastel (kandi, fairy floss) vs muted forest?
- Can we blend forest-soft with digital-soft somehow?
- Which projects get creature names vs phenomena vs textures?

---

**Notes:**
- This is a living document for exploration
- We may decide to keep some current names (dew, rescribe, zone fit multiple worlds)
- The goal is cohesion + cozy aesthetic + embodying vision, not rigid theming
- Names should manipulate people toward our values (approachable, playful, calm)
