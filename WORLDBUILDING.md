# Worldbuilding & Theme Exploration

Exploring cohesive naming through worldbuilding (post-NAMING.md clarity pivot).

## Why This Matters

**Naming is manipulation (the good kind).**

When people encounter your tools, the names create expectations:
- **Corporate names** (normalize, interconnect, DataPipeline) → "this is serious production software, I need expertise, this scales to billions"
- **Cozy names** (bubbletea, lipgloss, uxn) → "this is approachable, made by humans, I can try this casually"

The worldbuilding creates a **conceptual space**. If that space is cozy/collaborative/playful, people bring that energy. If it's corporate/technical/serious, they bring different energy.

**We want people to approach our tools with:**
- "This feels approachable, I can try it"
- "It's okay if I start small and imperfect"
- "This is made with care for humans"
- "This respects my time and doesn't demand expertise"

Not:
- "I need to read extensive docs first"
- "This is for serious production use only"
- "I should optimize and scale from day one"

**Our vision** (see docs/problems.md):
- Creation as play, not work
- First step trivially easy
- Permission to be imperfect
- Real connection (symmetric, not parasocial)
- Calm, respectful software
- Local-first, network-capable
- Collaboration should be natural (like games)
- Anti-corporate, anti-extraction, anti-metrics

If our names embody this vision, people *feel* it before reading any manifesto.

## Context

After pivoting from botanical names to clarity-focused names (see NAMING.md), we're evaluating whether our names have lost personality and become too generic/corporate.

**Current evaluation:**
- Some names work (dew, moonlet, habitat, concord, playmate)
- Some feel too corporate/enterprise (normalize, interconnect, reformer)
- Some feel too scientific (polymorphine/manyfold, polarizer)
- Overall: **no cohesive theme** - we have 8+ different semantic domains

## Desired Aesthetic

**Target vibe: pastel/tumblr/small web**

### Prior Art

**100 Rabbits (uxn ecosystem)**
- uxn, varvara, orca, left, nasu, pilot, ronin
- Simple words (4-6 letters), often lowercase
- Proper nouns or repurposed common words
- Human-scale, handmade feeling
- Permacomputing/solarpunk/smol tech
- Nothing corporate, nothing enterprise

**Sokpop Collective**
- simmiland, clutterbox, pipo park, badru, coiltackle, helkube
- Playful compounds or made-up names
- Lowercase cozy vibes
- Indie game/toy aesthetic
- "Made by small team in a weekend" energy
- Slightly nonsensical but charming

**Charm Bracelet**
- bubbletea, lipgloss, glamour, glow, bubbles, gum, pop, melt, soft-serve
- Delightful confections/aesthetics theme
- Short, fun, memorable
- Playful but professional
- Cohesive aesthetic without rigid taxonomy

**Tailwags**
- wag, bark, fetch, paws - dog/puppy domain
- Cute, playful, pastel, modern small-web
- Perfect vibe reference but they own the puppy space
- We want similar energy, different semantic territory

### Aesthetic: "Fluffy Pastel"

**Not:**
- Digital desktop vibes (too tech-forward)
- Vibrant/boisterous (too loud)
- Corporate/industrial (wrong energy entirely)

**Yes:**
- Fluffy/plushie soft (soft-shaded art, no harsh outlines)
- Pastel colors (fairy floss, kandi bracelets, gentle)
- Childlike wonder (not childish)
- Small-scale, intimate
- Gentle/hushed (not boisterous)
- Whimsical but calm
- Muted pastels
- Creative but unhurried

**References:**
- Needy Streamer Overload, Unpacking, Melatonin (soft digital life)
- Pastel pop, hyperpop aesthetics
- Kandi raver PLUR positivity
- Yaelokre "Harpy Hare" (small forest folk tale vibes)
- Soft treats (bubbletea, soft-serve)

### Name Characteristics

- Simple/short (4-7 letters ideal)
- Often lowercase in presentation
- Could be: real words repurposed, gentle compounds, soft neologisms
- Handmade/indie/personal feeling
- Playful but not jokey
- Soft sounds, gentle consonants
- Anti-enterprise, anti-scale
- itch.io/neocities/tilde/permacomputing vibes

## Vision → World Constraints

What kind of world embodies our values?

**Must feel:**
- Small-scale, human-sized (not infinite/overwhelming)
- Collaborative and symmetric (not hierarchical/broadcasting)
- Playful and creative (not serious/performative)
- Calm and unhurried (not demanding/urgent)
- Welcoming of imperfection (not polished/curated)
- Made with care (not industrial/automated)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Corporate office vibes (productivity, efficiency, optimization)
- Industrial/factory (mass production, scale, pipelines)
- Laboratory (sterile, precise, scientific)
- Military/command (hierarchical, authoritative, control)

**Patterns that work:**
- Small creative communities (studios, workshops, gardens)
- Collaborative making (working together on shared artifacts)
- Exploration and discovery (not optimization)
- Tending and care (not extraction)

## Worldbuilding Approach

Instead of "pick names from a category," build a **cohesive world** where all our tools naturally exist as things/concepts in that world.

**Challenge:** What cozy/pastel world naturally contains:
- Structural code intelligence (Normalize)
- Procedural generation (Unshape)
- API bindings (Concord)
- Data transformation (Paraphase)
- Runtime orchestration (Moonlet)
- Format conversion (rescribe)
- Federation protocols (Interconnect)
- Object stores (Lotus)
- Expression language (Dew)
- Game primitives (Playmate)
- Tool configuration (Myenv)
- Universal UI (Dusklight)
- Capability interfaces (Portals)
- Legacy lifting (Resurrect)
- Multi-protocol derives (Server-Less)

### Theme Explorations (Pastel-Fluffy Lens)

**❌ Workshop/Studio (cottagecore, not pastel)**
- loom, kiln, press, easel, bench
- Too earthy/physical, not soft enough
- Verdict: Wrong vibe

**❌ Digital Desktop/Virtual Room**
- window, widget, cache, pixel, sprite
- Too tech-forward, synthetic not soft
- Verdict: Interesting but misses fluffy gentleness

**🤔 Sweet Treats / Confections** (Charm Bracelet model)
- fizz, sprinkle, mochi, taffy, sherbet, sorbet, glaze
- ✅ Pastel-coded, sweet, gentle
- ❌ Encroaches on Charm's territory
- ❌ Might feel too sugary/surface
- Verdict: Right vibe but maybe derivative

**✅ Small Soft Things**
- bell, chime, ribbon, feather, petal, wisp, tuft
- ✅ Tactile, delicate, gentle
- ✅ Fluffy/plushie energy
- Verdict: Valid direction

**✅ Soft Sounds / Onomatopoeia**
- hum, murmur, chirp, tinkle, plink, whoosh, flutter
- ✅ Cute, playful, alive
- ✅ Gentle consonants, soft sounds
- Verdict: Valid direction

**✅ Weather/Atmosphere (soft phenomena)**
- mist, dew, haze, drift, breeze, drizzle, shimmer
- ✅ Ambient, calming, pastel-friendly
- ✅ Gentle, atmospheric
- Verdict: Valid direction

**❌ Toys/Playthings**
- block, marble, crayon, spinner, puzzle
- Too vibrant/boisterous
- Verdict: Wrong energy

**❌ Sleep/Dreams**
- dream, doze, nap, snooze, lull
- Too restful - doesn't inspire creativity
- Verdict: Too sleepy

## Current Names - Vibe Check

### ✅ Fits pastel/small-web aesthetic:
- **dew** - perfect
- **zone** - if lowercase, yes
- **rescribe** - handmade, soft

### 🤔 Could work with presentation:
- **habitat** - real word, soft
- **moonlet** - playful
- **concord** - simple word
- **playmate** - friendly

### ❌ Wrong vibe (too corporate/technical):
- **normalize** - AWS service
- **interconnect** - Cisco enterprise
- **reformer** - too serious
- **polymorphine/manyfold** - academic
- **typedrc** - too technical
- **polarizer** - science equipment
- **resurrect** - too theatrical
- **portals** - borderline, depends on world

## Leading Direction: Small Woodland Whispers 🍄

**The world:** Intimate small forest. Not grand wilderness - a gentle woodland glade. Small creatures, soft phenomena, folk tale magic. Harpy Hare / Yaelokre coded.

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Fluffy/soft aesthetic (moths, down, normalize)
- ✅ Gentle/hushed (whispers, rustles, murmurs)
- ✅ Small-scale, intimate
- ✅ Whimsical but calm
- ✅ Nature as break from technology ("touch grass" energy)
- ✅ Pastel-friendly (muted forest colors, dusk light)
- ✅ rhi (underground network) fits perfectly
- ✅ Creative but unhurried (natural growth, seasonal time)

**Combining three sub-themes:**

### 🦋 Small Forest Creatures/Elements
- moth, fern, normalize, acorn, twig, lichen, moonlet
- Gentle, small-scale nature
- Lives in the understory, not the dusklight

### 🌫️ Soft Phenomena (weather/light/sound)
- wisp, rustle, flutter, murmur, shimmer, haze, glow, glimmer
- Atmospheric, ambient
- Gentle movements and sounds

### 🧶 Soft Textures/Materials
- velvet, down, fleece, fluff, tuft, felt, cotton
- Plushie-coded, tactile softness
- Fluffy energy

**Example names from this world:**
moth, fern, wisp, rustle, flutter, murmur, velvet, down, shimmer, haze, glow, normalize, dusk, mist

**Aesthetic references:**
- Yaelokre "Harpy Hare" (small forest folk tales)
- Sable (pastel desert, soft art, gentle exploration)
- Feather (peaceful bird flying, pastel skies, no objectives)
- Ori (soft-shaded forest, gentle light, magical)
- Journey (pastel desert, flowing cloth, calm)
- Ghibli forests (soft light, magical, pastel)

**Key insight:** Pastel + nature works! Pick elements that are ALREADY soft/pastel/fluffy:
- ✅ sakura, petal, mist, moth, shimmer, wisp, dusk, dawn (inherently soft)
- ❌ bark, timber, root, branch (too earthy/rugged)

**The vibe:** Soft, hushed, intimate, whimsical-but-calm, gentle exploration, nature as respite, permission to be small and gentle. Pastel-magical-nature, not dark-wild-forest.

## Project Mapping - First Pass

Let's map each project to the Small Woodland Whispers world and see how names feel:

### ✅ Already Perfect
- **dew** (expression language) - morning moisture, gentle, already pastel-coded
- **rescribe** (document conversion) - not woodland but already good, keep it
- **zone** (monorepo) - decided for branding, keep it

### Code Intelligence (Normalize → ?)
**What it does:** Structural intelligence across 98 languages, sessions, packages, tools
**Current issue:** normalize too corporate
**Woodland options:**
- **moth** - small creature that navigates in the dark, sees patterns, drawn to light (understanding)
- **fern** - reveals structure through unfurling, fractal patterns
- **lichen** - composite organism (symbiosis of different things unified)
**Leaning:** moth (navigation, pattern-seeking, gentle)

### Procedural Generation (Unshape → ?)
**What it does:** Composable primitives for meshes, audio, textures
**Current issue:** polymorphine/manyfold too scientific
**Woodland options:**
- **shimmer** - light creating infinite patterns, ethereal beauty
- **petal** - simple unit that composes into flowers (compositional beauty)
- **wisp** - ethereal, transformative, magical manifestation
**Leaning:** petal (compositional, soft, beautiful)

### Lua Runtime (Moonlet → ?)
**What it does:** Batteries-included Lua runtime, orchestrates ecosystem
**Current issue:** infectious connotation
**Woodland options:**
- **glow** - small light source, welcoming, guides in darkness
- **nest** - safe contained space where things live and run
- **hollow** - cozy protected space (tree hollow)
**Leaning:** glow (small, welcoming, runtime = provides light to work)

### API Bindings (Concord → ?)
**What it does:** Unified IR for OpenAPI/gRPC/etc, generate bindings
**Current:** concord works but not woodland
**Woodland options:**
- **flutter** - movement between spaces, gentle connection
- **murmur** - soft communication, messages passing
- **rustle** - gentle interaction, things touching
**Leaning:** flutter (communication/connection, gentle, pastel-friendly)

### Federation Protocol (Interconnect → ?)
**What it does:** Connect persistent worlds, potential CRDT collaboration
**Current:** interconnect too corporate
**Woodland options:**
- **normalize** - spreads and connects, network organism
- **web** - natural connection structure (spider web with dew)
- **mycel** - shortened mycelium, underground network (too on-the-nose for rhizome?)
**Leaning:** normalize (network, gentle, pastel green)

### Capability Interfaces (Portals → ?)
**What it does:** Interface definitions, capability patterns, not authoritative
**Current:** portals borderline
**Woodland options:**
- **portal** - actually could work in magical forest context
- **gate** - entry point, small and humble
- **threshold** - between spaces, capability as crossing
**Leaning:** keep portal or try gate

### Pipeline Orchestrator (Paraphase → ?)
**What it does:** Type-driven data transformation, archival, composition
**Current:** reformer too serious
**Woodland options:**
- **drift** - gentle movement/transformation, water flowing
- **flow** - transformation through movement
- **mist** - transformation (water to air), soft, ephemeral
**Leaning:** mist (transformation, soft, pastel)

### Legacy Software Lifting (Resurrect → ?)
**What it does:** Flash/Java applets → modern runtimes
**Current:** resurrect too theatrical
**Woodland options:**
- **bloom** - bringing life back, renewal
- **sprout** - new growth from old
- **revive** - soft word for resurrection
**Leaning:** bloom (gentle rebirth, hopeful)

### Game Primitives (Playmate → ?)
**What it does:** State machines, controllers, patterns
**Current:** playmate works but not woodland
**Woodland options:**
- **flutter** - (if not used for API bindings) movement, reactive
- **hop** - small playful movement
- **skip** - playful movement pattern
**Leaning:** skip (playful, game-coded, gentle)

### Universal UI (Dusklight → ?)
**What it does:** Control plane for any data source
**Current:** polarizer too technical
**Woodland options:**
- **view** - simple, what it does
- **lens** - (avoiding FP collision) way of seeing
- **glimpse** - soft way of viewing
**Leaning:** glimpse (gentle observation)

### Object Store (Lotus → ?)
**What it does:** Persistent scriptable object habitat
**Current:** habitat works but not woodland
**Woodland options:**
- **grove** - place where things live together
- **glade** - open space in forest, gathering place
- **dell** - small valley, sheltered
**Leaning:** grove (habitat for objects, gentle)

### Config Management (Myenv → ?)
**What it does:** Type-safe unified config management
**Current:** typedrc too technical
**Woodland options:**
- **seed** - configuration as starting point
- **root** - foundation (but too earthy?)
- **stem** - central organizing structure
**Leaning:** seed (configs as seeds that grow into setup)

### Multi-protocol Derives (Server-Less → ?)
**What it does:** One impl → many protocols
**Current:** server-less good but not woodland
**Woodland options:**
- Keep server-less? It works
**Leaning:** keep server-less

- **API bindings** (flutter conflicts with Flutter): rustle, murmur, whisper?

## Key Learnings from Exploration

### What We Discovered

**Namespace Reality:**
- Most obvious soft/gentle words are TAKEN on crates.io (moth, mist, bloom, glow, wisp, etc.)
- Soft woodland namespace is extremely crowded
- Compound words (gentlebreeze, softglow) are available but feel fantasy-location-coded ("Welcome to Brightthread Village")
- Need to be more creative than "pick cute words from nature"

**The Charmbracelet Insight:**
Charmbracelet doesn't just use "cute words" - they use **concrete nouns (THINGS)** that **metaphorically relate to their vision**:
- Vision: Making terminals beautiful/delightful
- Things: lipgloss (makes things pretty), bubbletea (delightful treat), glamour (makes things glamorous), glow (makes things shine)
- NOT random cute things, NOT adjectives/verbs, NOT abstract concepts

**Our Challenge:**
We need concrete nouns (things) that metaphorically relate to OUR vision:
- Vision: Unification simplifies fragmented complexity into something playful/approachable
- Things: ??? (what kinds of objects embody simplification/unification/making-big-things-playable?)

### Available Words Found

**Concrete nouns with potential:**
- dew ✅ (we have it!)
- petal ✅
- dewdrop ✅
- moonbeam ✅
- kaleidoscope ✅ (shifting patterns - procedural gen?)
- snowglobe ✅ (contained world - object store?)
- yarn ✅ (threading - federation?)
- watercolor ✅ (blending - transformation?)
- plushie ✅, stuffy ✅

**Adjective/feelings (but not things):**
- plush, fleece, satin, foam, snug, cozy, fluffy, puffy, cloudy, misty, dewy, bubbly, glowy

**Actions (but not things):**
- untangle ✅ (actually good metaphor for code intelligence!)
- betwixt ✅ (between - federation?)

### What We're Stuck On

**The Core Question:**
What kinds of THINGS metaphorically capture "unification makes complexity simple enough to play with"?

Possible metaphor spaces explored:
- ❓ Distillation/essence (complex → pure) - but sounds too scientific
- ❓ Toy-sized/miniatures (big → small enough to hold) - but which specific toys?
- ❓ Optics/lenses (many views → focused clarity) - most taken
- ❓ Craft/gentle creation - but which items aren't archaic (no thimbles/brooches)?

**Open Questions:**
- Do we even need categorical coherence, or just consistent feeling across different sources?
- Is there a metaphor space we haven't considered?
- Should some current names stay (dew, rescribe, moonlet work well)?
- Are we overthinking this?

---

**Notes:**
- This is a living document for exploration
- We may decide to keep some current names (dew, rescribe, zone fit multiple worlds)
- The goal is cohesion + cozy aesthetic + embodying vision, not rigid theming
- Names should manipulate people toward our values (approachable, playful, calm)
