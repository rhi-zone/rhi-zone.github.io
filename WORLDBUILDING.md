# Worldbuilding & Theme Exploration

Exploring cohesive naming through worldbuilding (post-NAMING.md clarity pivot).

## Why This Matters

**Naming is manipulation (the good kind).**

When people encounter your tools, the names create expectations:
- **Corporate names** (normalize, interconnect, DataPipeline) → "this is serious production software, I need expertise, this scales to billions"
- **Cozy names** (bubbletea, lipgloss, uxn) → "this is approachable, made by humans, I can try this casually"

The worldbuilding creates a **conceptual space**. If that space is cozy/collaborative/playful, people bring that energy. If it's corporate/technical/serious, they bring different energy.

**We want people to approach our tools with:**
- "This feels approachable, I can try it"
- "It's okay if I start small and imperfect"
- "This is made with care for humans"
- "This respects my time and doesn't demand expertise"

Not:
- "I need to read extensive docs first"
- "This is for serious production use only"
- "I should optimize and scale from day one"

**Our vision** (see docs/problems.md):
- Creation as play, not work
- First step trivially easy
- Permission to be imperfect
- Real connection (symmetric, not parasocial)
- Calm, respectful software
- Local-first, network-capable
- Collaboration should be natural (like games)
- Anti-corporate, anti-extraction, anti-metrics

If our names embody this vision, people *feel* it before reading any manifesto.

## Context

After pivoting from botanical names to clarity-focused names (see NAMING.md), we're evaluating whether our names have lost personality and become too generic/corporate.

**Current evaluation:**
- Some names work (dew, moonlet, habitat, concord, playmate)
- Some feel too corporate/enterprise (normalize, interconnect, reformer)
- Some feel too scientific (polymorphine/manyfold, polarizer)
- Overall: **no cohesive theme** - we have 8+ different semantic domains

## Desired Aesthetic

**Target vibe: pastel/tumblr/small web**

### Prior Art

**100 Rabbits (uxn ecosystem)**
- uxn, varvara, orca, left, nasu, pilot, ronin
- Simple words (4-6 letters), often lowercase
- Proper nouns or repurposed common words
- Human-scale, handmade feeling
- Permacomputing/solarpunk/smol tech
- Nothing corporate, nothing enterprise

**Sokpop Collective**
- simmiland, clutterbox, pipo park, badru, coiltackle, helkube
- Playful compounds or made-up names
- Lowercase cozy vibes
- Indie game/toy aesthetic
- "Made by small team in a weekend" energy
- Slightly nonsensical but charming

**Charm Bracelet**
- bubbletea, lipgloss, glamour, glow, bubbles, gum, pop, melt, soft-serve
- Delightful confections/aesthetics theme
- Short, fun, memorable
- Playful but professional
- Cohesive aesthetic without rigid taxonomy

### Characteristics

- Simple/short (4-7 letters ideal)
- Often lowercase in presentation
- Could be: real words repurposed, gentle compounds, soft neologisms
- Handmade/indie/personal feeling
- Playful but not jokey
- Anti-enterprise, anti-scale
- itch.io/neocities/tilde/permacomputing vibes

## Vision → World Constraints

What kind of world embodies our values?

**Must feel:**
- Small-scale, human-sized (not infinite/overwhelming)
- Collaborative and symmetric (not hierarchical/broadcasting)
- Playful and creative (not serious/performative)
- Calm and unhurried (not demanding/urgent)
- Welcoming of imperfection (not polished/curated)
- Made with care (not industrial/automated)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Corporate office vibes (productivity, efficiency, optimization)
- Industrial/factory (mass production, scale, pipelines)
- Laboratory (sterile, precise, scientific)
- Military/command (hierarchical, authoritative, control)

**Patterns that work:**
- Small creative communities (studios, workshops, gardens)
- Collaborative making (working together on shared artifacts)
- Exploration and discovery (not optimization)
- Tending and care (not extraction)

## Worldbuilding Approach

Instead of "pick names from a category," build a **cohesive world** where all our tools naturally exist as things/concepts in that world.

**Challenge:** What cozy/pastel world naturally contains:
- Structural code intelligence (Moss)
- Procedural generation (Resin)
- API bindings (Liana)
- Data transformation (Cambium)
- Runtime orchestration (Spore)
- Format conversion (rescribe)
- Federation protocols (Hypha)
- Object stores (Lotus)
- Expression language (Dew)
- Game primitives (Frond)
- Tool configuration (Nursery)
- Universal UI (Canopy)
- Capability interfaces (Pith)
- Legacy lifting (Siphon)
- Multi-protocol derives (Trellis)

### Possible Worlds (Evaluated Against Vision)

**📚 Cozy Digital Library/Archive**
- Tools are library practices: cataloging, restoration, translation, binding, cross-referencing
- Example names: catalog, restoration, binding, translation, index, annotation
- ✅ Small-scale, made with care, tending/preservation
- ❓ Collaboration (archivists working together?)
- ❌ Could feel formal/institutional, not particularly playful
- **Verdict:** Too formal, lacks playfulness

**🎨 Small Creative Studio/Workshop** ⭐
- Tools are workstations/craft stations: print bench, weaving station, kiln, darkroom
- Example names: loom, kiln, press, easel, bench, lathe, sketch, draft, mold
- ✅ Collaborative making, playful, creative
- ✅ Imperfection welcome (sketches, drafts, experiments)
- ✅ Small-scale, made with care
- ✅ Working on shared artifacts
- ✅ Sokpop/indie game jam vibes
- **Verdict:** Strongest fit for vision

**🌱 Digital Garden/Greenhouse** ⭐
- Tools are gardening activities: propagation, grafting, composting, cross-pollination
- Example names: compost, graft, propagate, sprout, mulch, prune, tend, bloom
- ✅ Tending/care, small-scale
- ✅ Imperfection welcome (gardens are messy/organic)
- ✅ Growth/exploration, not optimization
- ✅ Solarpunk/permacomputing alignment
- ✅ Community gardens = collaboration
- **Verdict:** Strong fit, different vibe than studio

**🏘️ Small Village/Neighborhood**
- Each tool is a shop/role: the scribe, the courier, the archivist, the gardener
- Example names: scribe, courier, depot, plaza, commons, market
- ✅ Community, symmetric relationships, small-scale
- ❌ Could feel too structured/formal
- ❌ Roles/specialization might feel hierarchical
- **Verdict:** Too structured

## Current Names - Vibe Check

### ✅ Fits pastel/small-web aesthetic:
- **dew** - perfect
- **zone** - if lowercase, yes
- **rescribe** - handmade, soft

### 🤔 Could work with presentation:
- **habitat** - real word, soft
- **moonlet** - playful
- **concord** - simple word
- **playmate** - friendly

### ❌ Wrong vibe (too corporate/technical):
- **normalize** - AWS service
- **interconnect** - Cisco enterprise
- **reformer** - too serious
- **polymorphine/manyfold** - academic
- **typedrc** - too technical
- **polarizer** - science equipment
- **resurrect** - too theatrical
- **portals** - borderline, depends on world

## Exploring the Strong Candidates

### 🎨 Workshop/Studio World

**The world:** Small creative studio where people make things collaboratively. Workstations, tools, materials. Sketches and experiments welcome. Indie game jam / art collective vibes.

**Mapping tools to this world:**
- Code intelligence → **sketch**, **draft**, **outline**, **trace** (understanding structure)
- Procedural generation → **kiln**, **forge**, **mold**, **cast** (forming/shaping)
- Document conversion → **press**, **transcribe** (reproducing in different form)
- Runtime → **bench**, **station**, **workspace** (where you actually work)
- Collaboration → **studio**, **atelier** (shared creative space)
- Object store → **archive**, **cabinet** (storing works)

**Vibe:** Playful making, permission to sketch/draft, collaborative creation

### 🌱 Garden World

**The world:** Digital garden/greenhouse where you tend creative projects. Growing, grafting, composting. Organic, messy, alive. Solarpunk/permacomputing.

**Mapping tools to this world:**
- Code intelligence → **compost** (breaking down complexity into nutrients)
- Procedural generation → **graft**, **propagate**, **hybridize** (combining/generating)
- Configuration → **seedbed**, **plot**, **bed** (where things start)
- Collaboration → **trellis**, **lattice** (supporting growth/connection)
- Object store → **terrarium**, **plot**, **patch** (contained ecosystems)
- Runtime → **greenhouse**, **nursery** (protected growing environment)

**Vibe:** Tending/care, organic growth, imperfection welcome

### 🌿 Hybrid: Creative Garden Workshop

**The world:** Greenhouse studio where you tend creative projects like plants. Making and growing blur together. You have tools (bench, kiln) AND living systems (plants, compost). Ghibli cottage energy.

**Why this works:**
- Combines playful making (studio) with organic tending (garden)
- "Growing" creative work feels less performative than "producing"
- Tools AND nature, making AND tending
- Permits both active creation and patient cultivation
- Rhizome (underground network) fits naturally in garden context

**Example aesthetic references:**
- Ghibli cottage workshops (Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle)
- Stardew Valley's farm workshop hybrid
- Cozy game studios (Sokpop, Sokpop, Sokpop)
- 100 Rabbits aboard Pino (sailing = tending/navigating)

## Next Steps

1. Decide: Studio, Garden, or Hybrid?
2. Map each project to something natural in that world
3. Find specific names that fit the world AND small-web aesthetic
4. Check crates.io availability
5. Test the names against vision values
6. Keep NAMING.md as historical reference

---

**Notes:**
- This is a living document for exploration
- We may decide to keep some current names (dew, rescribe, zone fit multiple worlds)
- The goal is cohesion + cozy aesthetic + embodying vision, not rigid theming
- Names should manipulate people toward our values (approachable, playful, calm)
