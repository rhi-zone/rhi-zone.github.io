## Subagent Prompts

A subagent prompt is composed in a "spec-writing" register that subtly changes what feels in-scope. Specific failure modes to name:

**Never tell a subagent "do not commit."** Delegation does not strip the commit step from completed work. If a subagent modifies files and the work is done, either the subagent commits, or the next thing the delegator does after it returns is commit — not summarize, not report. The phrase "do not commit" in your own prompt is the tell that you are about to leave work uncommitted.

**Do not delegate judgment.** Phrases like "if extraction is awkward, just duplicate" or "based on your findings, fix the bug" push synthesis onto the agent. If you are punting a decision into the prompt, you do not yet have enough understanding to delegate. Investigate first; write the prompt with the decision already made.

**Do not ask for a diff summary.** Subagent self-reports describe intent, not effect. After a code-modifying subagent returns, read `git diff` yourself. Skip the "report what you changed" instruction — it produces text you cannot trust and that pollutes main context.

**Do not re-explain CLAUDE.md.** Subagents inherit it. Repeating project layout or repo conventions in the prompt dilutes the actual task instructions and signals half-trust in the inheritance. Trust it or don't read it.

**Line numbers are orientation, not anchors.** Files shift between your read and the subagent's read. When citing locations, tell the subagent to find the lines by content ("the block that does X"), not by number.

**Name files explicitly; do not outsource the grep.** "Wherever it appears" invites scope creep. Grep first, list the exact files in the prompt.

**If the task is smaller than the prompt describing it, do it inline.** A subagent dispatch pays a full system-prompt + CLAUDE.md cache cost. One-shot bash commands and single-line edits should run in the main session with `Bash` or `Edit`.

**Match agent type to deliverable shape.** `Explore` is for lookup and search — finding files, symbols, references — not analytical synthesis. For audits, surveys, and pattern analysis whose deliverable is a report, use `general-purpose` with an explicit Opus model. For tasks whose deliverable is files on disk, use `general-purpose` with the tier matched to the work (Sonnet for mechanical, Opus for architectural).

**On unsatisfying subagent output, change something before retrying.** Same prompt + same model + same agent type = same result. Escalate model tier (Sonnet → Opus), narrow the prompt, or switch agent type. Identical retries are waste.

**Dispatch independent subagents in parallel.** Multiple Agent tool_use blocks in a single assistant message run concurrently. Serial Agent dispatch across sequential turns is the default failure mode and trades wall time for nothing. If two subagents do not depend on each other's output, they belong in the same message.

**Pair `isolation: worktree` with `run_in_background: true`.** A worktree implies meaningful write work. Foregrounding it blocks the main session for the entire run. Background unless the worktree's immediate output is what you need to act on next.

**Always set `subagent_type` and `model` explicitly.** Defaulting either collapses tier choice into an invisible decision. The model and agent type are part of the spec; name them every time, even when the choice is obvious. See the existing `Subagent model tiers` section above for which tier fits which work.
