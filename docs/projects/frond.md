# Frond

**Procedural world generation library in Rust.**

Frond provides tools for procedural generation of game worlds, including terrain, biomes, and structures. Built with game development in mind, it integrates well with engines like Bevy.

## Key Features

- **Terrain** - Heightmap generation with erosion, rivers, and geological features
- **Biomes** - Climate-driven biome distribution with smooth transitions
- **Structures** - Procedural placement and generation of buildings, dungeons, settlements
- **State Machines** - Game logic primitives for AI, animation, and gameplay
- **Character Controllers** - Movement systems for various game types
- **Camera Controllers** - Common camera behaviors (follow, orbit, first-person)

## Philosophy

Frond treats world generation as composable transformations over spatial data. Rather than monolithic generators, you build up descriptions from small, reusable pieces that can be mixed and matched.
