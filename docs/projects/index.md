# Projects

Rhizome is an ecosystem of tools for programmable creativity—software that treats code, worlds, and media as malleable structures rather than opaque text or binary blobs.

## Code Intelligence

### [Moss](/projects/moss)

Structural code intelligence for humans and AI agents. Moss provides AST-aware tools for understanding, navigating, and modifying code across 98 languages.

## Generation

### [Resin](/projects/resin)

Constructive media generation in Rust. Procedural meshes, audio synthesis, textures, 2D vector graphics, and skeletal rigging with composable node graphs.

### [Dew](/projects/dew)

Minimal expression language for procedural generation. Small, ephemeral, perfectly formed. Compiles to WGSL shaders, Cranelift JIT, or Lua.

## Games & Worlds

### [Frond](/projects/frond)

Game design primitives library. State machines, character controllers, camera systems, and common gameplay patterns.

### [Hypha](/projects/hypha)

Federation protocol for persistent worlds. Authoritative handoff between servers—no state merging, no split-brain attacks.

## Data Transformation

### [Cambium](/projects/cambium)

Pipeline orchestrator for data conversion. Type-driven route planning for asset pipelines—agents declare intent, Cambium finds the path.

### [Liana](/projects/liana)

API bindings IR and code generation. Unified representation for generating bindings across languages and frameworks.

### [Siphon](/projects/siphon)

Legacy software lifting framework. Extract and transform applications from obsolete runtimes (Flash, Director, VB6) into modern web equivalents.

## Runtime & Interface

### [Spore](/projects/spore)

Lua runtime with plugin system for the Rhizome ecosystem.

### [Canopy](/projects/canopy)

Universal UI client with control plane. View, mutate, and control any data source through configurable interfaces.

## Infrastructure

### [Nursery](/projects/nursery)

Unified tool configuration and project scaffolding. Manage all tool configs from one manifest, scaffold projects from seeds.

### [Pith](/projects/pith)

Standard library interfaces. Capability-based, async-first APIs inspired by WASI.

### [Flora](/projects/flora)

Lua-based tools, scaffolds, and orchestration. Contains agent scripts, project seeds for nursery, and shared Lua utilities.

### [Trellis](/projects/trellis)

Composable derive macros for Rust. Reduce boilerplate across the ecosystem.
