# Projects

Rhizome is an ecosystem of tools for programmable creativity—software that treats code, worlds, and media as malleable structures rather than opaque text or binary blobs.

## Active Projects

### [Moss](/projects/moss)

Structural code intelligence for humans and AI agents. Moss provides AST-aware tools for understanding, navigating, and modifying code across 98 languages.

### [Lotus](/projects/lotus)

A LambdaMOO-inspired Lua runtime with persistent entity storage. Build scriptable objects, rooms, NPCs, and multiplayer worlds with capability-based security.

### [Resin](/projects/resin)

Constructive media generation in Rust. Procedural meshes, audio synthesis, textures, 2D vector graphics, and skeletal rigging with composable node graphs.

### [Sap](/projects/sap)

Expression language for procedural generation. Compiles to WGSL shaders, Cranelift JIT, or Lua for flexible evaluation across GPU and CPU.

### [Liana](/projects/liana)

API bindings IR and code generation. Unified representation for generating bindings across languages and frameworks.

### [Cambium](/projects/cambium)

Pipeline orchestrator for data conversion. Type-driven route planning for asset pipelines—agents declare intent, Cambium finds the path.

### [Canopy](/projects/canopy)

Universal UI client for arbitrary data. Infinitely configurable views for static, streamed, or live data in any format.
