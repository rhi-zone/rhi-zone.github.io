## What Rhizome Actually Is

Rhizome isn't a master plan, or a city, or THE solution, or a polished product.

It's "I made some stuff." Hacky prototypes. Experiments that might fail. Things built to see what happens, based on conversations (some with LLMs giving questionable ideas).

ARPANET energy: "This technically works, we don't know if it scales, it's held together with duct tape and enthusiasm."

The original hacker spirit, actually. Before it got stolen. Just making things because you can. No grand claims. See what sticks. Maybe some of it will be useful. Maybe it won't. But the making is the point.

## The "What If?" Question

The real, fundamental goal: **subsuming virtually all interaction with a computer.**

- Of course it'll never happen
- Of course it won't take off
- Of course there's tradeoffs
- **But what if? What would it look like?**

This is the "what if?" question carried to its logical extreme. Not "this will win" but "if it did, what would it be?"

Everything else in Rhizome is in service of this question. Structure for agents, so computers understand themselves. Tags not hierarchies, so everything's findable. Hyper-modularity, so you compose what you need. The exploration itself is valuable, even if the destination is unreachable.

## Questioning Accepted Tradeoffs

Lots of software makes tradeoffs. Some do things well. But in general:

| Pain point | Why do we accept this? |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Multi-app workflows | Use X then Y then Z for one task. Why not integrated? |
| Settings sprawl | Dialog after dialog after dialog. It's just data! |
| Notes apps | Paper skeuomorphism on a $2000 interactive machine |
| Chat history as AI context | Linear conversation = amnesia. Why not world state? |
| Different stdlib per language | Everyone reinvents the same things |
| Format conversion | Hunt for exotic tools, pray they exist |

These are all "accepted" tradeoffs that maybe shouldn't be accepted. The question isn't "can we make software" - it's "can we make software that doesn't make these tradeoffs?" Or at least makes different ones.

## Objects, Not Documents

Hot take: notes apps are paper skeuomorphism on the most interactive medium ever created.

Paper affordances: static, linear, you write and it sits there, you have to remember it exists, organization is manual.

What computers can do: execute, respond, connect, trigger, compute views on the fly, come to you instead of waiting.

We have the most interactive medium ever created and use it to simulate sheets of paper with text. Then we add "features" like backlinks and tags, which are just compensating for the base metaphor being wrong.

The right question isn't "how do I organize my notes?" It's "why am I taking notes at all when I have a computer?"

The thesis, clarified:
- Objects > Documents
- Things that live > things that sit
- Active > passive
- Comes to you > you go to it

Not a second brain. A living system.

## Who Might Care

You might find Rhizome useful if you:

- Build tools and want structural primitives (ASTs, specs, pipelines)
- Work with multiple languages/platforms and want codegen from specs
- Care about preserving meaning during transformation (not just "it compiles")
- Want procedural generation that's deterministic and portable
- Think notes apps are solving the wrong problem
- Escaped the attention economy into deep work and want tools that match

You probably won't care if you want polished, production-ready software today, or need stability over experimentation, or are looking for a product rather than a toolkit.
