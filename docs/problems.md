# Problems

Before solutions. Before tools. What's actually wrong?

This isn't about software. It's about people.

## Why Do People Not Do Things?

They want to create. They have ideas. They don't start. Or they start and don't finish. Why?

- **Fear of failure** - What if it's bad? What if I'm bad?
- **Fear of judgment** - What will people think?
- **Perfectionism** - Can't start until it's perfect in my head. It's never perfect in my head.
- **The gap** - The distance between the idea and the execution feels insurmountable.
- **Decision paralysis** - Too many options. Which tool? Which approach? Which thing to make first?
- **Previous attempts felt bad** - Tried before. It sucked. Why would this time be different?
- **It stopped being fun** - Used to enjoy it. Now it feels like work. Or obligation. Or performance.
- **No immediate reward** - The payoff is distant. The couch is right here.
- **No one to share it with** - What's the point if nobody sees it? Or worse - what if they do?
- **Easier things grab attention** - Infinite scroll is right there. Zero effort. Guaranteed stimulation.
- **Life** - Depression. Burnout. Exhaustion. Responsibilities. Health. Money. Time.

Some of these are ancient. Some were created by software. The infinite scroll didn't exist until someone built it. The comparison metrics didn't exist until platforms added them. The attention economy is a design choice, not a law of nature.

Software has power. It's been used to create these problems. Could it be used to address them?

## Why Are People Sad?

Not clinically. Just... the ambient background sadness that seems everywhere.

- **Loneliness** - Surrounded by people, connected to no one.
- **Lack of meaning** - What's the point? Of work, of effort, of anything?
- **Comparison** - Everyone else seems to have it figured out. They don't, but it looks like they do.
- **Feeling stuck** - Same patterns, same problems, no way out visible.
- **Feeling unseen** - Nobody really knows you. Or the you they know isn't the real you.
- **Wrong environment** - The place, the job, the relationship, the life - it doesn't fit. But changing is terrifying.
- **Chronic stress** - Always something. Never a break. The baseline is anxiety.
- **Loss** - Of people, of possibilities, of the person you thought you'd be.

Loneliness existed before software. But "connected to everyone, close to no one" is new. The curated highlight reel making everyone else's life look perfect is new.

And the **parasocial relationship** is new at scale. You feel like you know someone. You follow their life, their thoughts, their struggles. They don't know you exist. This asymmetry - one person broadcasting to millions, each feeling a personal connection - creates a new kind of loneliness. You have "relationships" that only flow one direction. You invest emotional energy into people who can't possibly reciprocate because they don't know you're there.

Software created new forms of sadness. It amplified existing ones. That means software has power here too.

## Why Are Some Games Good?

Not all. Some. What makes them work?

- **Clear goals** - You know what you're trying to do.
- **Good feedback** - You know if you're doing it well. Immediately. Not after a performance review.
- **Mastery curve** - Hard enough to be interesting. Not so hard you quit. You get better and it feels good.
- **Meaningful choices** - What you decide matters. Not just the illusion of choice.
- **Flow state** - Time disappears. You're fully there.
- **Respect for your time** - The game values your hours. It doesn't waste them to inflate metrics.
- **Surprise and delight** - Moments of unexpected joy.
- **Social connection** - Playing with others. Real connection, not leaderboard comparison.

Good games are designed around what makes humans feel good. Not what extracts the most from them.

## Why Is Social Media The Worst Game?

It's a game. It has mechanics, rewards, feedback loops. But optimized for what?

- **Engagement, not wellbeing** - The goal is time-on-platform. Not your happiness.
- **Variable reward schedule** - Slot machine psychology. Maybe this scroll will have something good.
- **Social comparison baked in** - Likes, followers, metrics. Your worth as a number.
- **Outrage spreads faster** - Anger is engaging. Calm isn't. The algorithm knows.
- **Metrics as self-worth** - How many likes? How many views? Why didn't they respond?
- **Performative connection** - Curated highlights. Not real relationships.
- **Asymmetry baked in** - One broadcasts, millions consume. You know them, they don't know you. Parasocial by design.
- **Designed to be addictive** - Not an accident. Not a side effect. The goal.
- **Your attention is the product** - You're not the customer. Advertisers are.
- **No endpoint** - Good games end. Social media never does. There's always more scroll.

The worst game because it uses all the techniques of good games - but inverted. Exploiting instead of serving.

## Why Does Discord Work?

Not perfect. But different. And the difference matters.

- **Community, not audience** - You're in a server with people. Not broadcasting to followers. Symmetric relationships - people who know each other, not parasocial one-way flows.
- **No algorithmic feed** - You see what's posted, in order. Nobody's optimizing your attention.
- **Servers have culture** - Each one is different. Has history. Has norms. Has regulars.
- **Conversation, not performance** - You're talking with people, not curating a highlight reel.
- **Persistence** - The server exists. The history exists. You can scroll back and see what happened.
- **You're already there** - Low friction. No new app. No new identity. Just... join.

Different design choices → different outcomes. Discord isn't trying to maximize engagement metrics. It's trying to be a place where people hang out.

Still has problems. Moderation is hard. Discoverability is weird. Notifications can be overwhelming. But the core dynamic is different from feed-based social media. That matters.

**The telling thing:** If Discord is your primary social media, you might read the "why is social media the worst game" section and think "is this even real? I'm fine."

You're fine *because of the design choices*. Not because the problems don't exist. People on Twitter/Instagram/TikTok are experiencing something fundamentally different. The medium shapes the experience. You might not understand why social media is toxic - because yours isn't.

## Why Does Software Often Make Things Worse?

Not all software. But a lot of it.

- **Complexity as moat** - Hard to learn = hard to leave. Captured users.
- **Features over simplicity** - More checkboxes on the marketing page. Worse actual experience.
- **Growth at all costs** - Users are metrics. Engagement is the goal. Wellbeing is irrelevant.
- **Advertising model** - If you're not paying, you're the product. Your attention is sold.
- **Designed for addiction** - Dark patterns. Infinite scroll. Notifications that demand response.
- **No ownership** - You rent access. They can change terms. Your stuff lives on their servers.
- **Updates that remove features** - What worked yesterday might not tomorrow.
- **Subscription everything** - Pay forever or lose access.

None of this is inevitable. It's choices made by people. Different choices are possible.

## What Would Actually Help?

Not convenience. Not "slightly easier." Actual change.

- **First step trivially easy** - Not tutorials. Not setup. You do something and it exists. Thirty seconds.
- **Permission to be imperfect** - Constraints that say "of course it's rough, that's the point." PICO-8 energy. Dwitter energy.
- **Creation as reward** - The making feels good. Not the likes. Not the metrics. The making itself.
- **Real connection** - Building together. Not performing for each other. Shared artifacts, not curated highlights. Symmetric - you know the people who know you.
- **Escape from infinite** - Not infinite scroll, infinite backlog, infinite guilt. You choose when to stop. The system doesn't exploit your inability to find a stopping point.
- **Calm** - Software that doesn't demand. Doesn't notify. Doesn't make you feel behind.

These aren't features. They're design values. They require building differently, not adding functionality.

What form would it take? A game? A website? A creative tool? A chat server? Something else?

Unknown. The form follows from the values, not the other way around. Discord didn't start by saying "let's make a chat app" - it started with "let's make a place for gamers to hang out." The chat app was an implementation of that intent.

Whatever form it takes would need to *embody* these values, not just have them as afterthoughts. Calm can't be bolted on. Symmetry can't be added later. These shape the architecture from the start.

## Where Rhizome Actually Is

Honest assessment.

**What exists: foundations**

Moss, Resin, Cambium, Spore, Liana, etc. These are infrastructure. Plumbing. They make things *possible*:
- Moss makes code understandable (to tools, to agents)
- Resin makes procedural generation composable
- Cambium makes format conversion type-driven
- Spore makes scripting embeddable

Useful. Real. Working (mostly).

But nobody lives in a foundation. Infrastructure doesn't make the first step trivially easy. It doesn't give permission to be imperfect. It doesn't create real connection.

**What doesn't exist: the things that help**

- The environment where you describe a thing and it exists
- The place where creation is play, not work
- The community where you build together and stumble on what others made
- The calm software that respects your time and attention

These would be built *on* the foundations. They don't exist yet.

**The gap**

We have plumbing. We don't have a house.

The foundations are necessary but not sufficient. The tools serve a vision, but the vision isn't realized. Most of the work is still ahead.

This is honest. Not pessimistic - the foundations matter. But not pretending that Moss solves loneliness or Resin makes creation fun. They're steps toward something. Not the something itself.

## What Would "Not Making It Worse" Look Like?

Not a solution. Just... not adding to the problem.

- Respect time. Don't waste it.
- No addiction mechanics. No dark patterns.
- Ownership. Your stuff is yours.
- Honest complexity. As simple as possible, no simpler.
- Offline-first. Not dependent on servers that might disappear.
- No metrics as self-worth. Or no metrics at all.
- Escape from infinite. You choose when to stop.
- Calm. Not demanding constant attention.

This isn't a product spec. It's a set of values. A filter for decisions.
