You're not bad at computers. Software is actually hard to use. Here's why.

## It hides what it can do

You know the app can do something. You've done it before. You just can't find it.

Menu hunting. File → Edit → View → Tools → where is it? Each app organizes differently. The answer is "memorize the arbitrary structure" or "hunt every time."

Modifier key mystery. Ctrl+K does something. Ctrl+Shift+K does something else. How would you know? Nobody tells you. Power users find out by accident or word of mouth.

Settings sprawl. Somewhere in Preferences → General → Advanced → (scroll) → (scroll) is the thing you want. Probably.

The pattern: software has capabilities, but won't tell you what they are. You hunt. You guess. You Google. You watch tutorials for apps you've used for years.

This isn't your fault. It's a design choice. The functionality is *hidden* - buried in menus, implicit in code, never surfaced. There's no way to ask "what can I do here?"

## It's complicated on purpose

Complexity as moat. If software is hard to learn, it's hard to leave. You've invested in mastering the hiding places. Switching costs are high. Some companies benefit from this.

Features as marketing. More checkboxes on the comparison page. Doesn't matter if they make the app worse to use - they make it easier to sell. Features accumulate. Nobody removes them.

The result: bloated software that does everything, where finding anything takes expertise.

## The wrong people decide

Software is built by engineers. Engineers optimize for what engineers value: features, flexibility, power. Not simplicity, not learnability, not "can my mom use this?"

Interaction design - thinking carefully about how humans actually use things - is dismissed as "not real engineering." So it doesn't get engineering effort.

And when designers *are* involved, they're often overruled by product managers optimizing for metrics, or executives who want feature parity with competitors.

The people building the software aren't the people using it. And the incentives don't align.

## It got stuck

The way software works - windows, icons, menus, clicking - was invented in the 1970s. It was revolutionary then.

Then it froze. The paradigm calcified before anyone questioned whether it was actually good. We've been doing the same thing for 50 years, adding features on top, never rethinking the foundation.

Worse: the toolkits locked it in. Windows gives developers `CreateMenu()` but not `CreateRadialMenu()`. So everyone uses linear menus - not because they're better, but because they're *there*. The paradigm calcified around what happened to be implemented in 1990.

We once had spatial interfaces (the original Mac Finder remembered where each folder's window was - you knew where things lived). We threw them away for "efficiency." Now we hunt through identical-looking folders because the toolkits didn't support anything else.

We once had [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) - anyone could build interactive things, and many did. Apple neglected it to death. The dream of "everyone can make software" died with it. See [prior art](/prior-art#accessible-creation) for what we lost.

We inherited the paradigm, not the reasoning behind it.

## It doesn't respect your time

Good software values your hours. Bad software wastes them to inflate metrics.

- Notifications that demand attention for things that don't matter
- Engagement loops designed to keep you in the app
- Updates that move things around so you have to relearn
- Loading screens, splash screens, "what's new" screens
- Features that require clicking through five dialogs

None of this helps you do what you came to do. It helps the software company hit their numbers.

Your time is not their priority.

## What good software feels like

It exists. You've probably used some. It feels different:

- You can find things
- It tells you what's possible
- New features don't break old workflows
- It loads fast and gets out of your way
- It respects that you have other things to do
- You get better at it over time, and it rewards that

This isn't magic. It's choices. Someone decided to prioritize your experience over their metrics. Someone thought carefully about how you'd actually use it. Someone said "no" to features that would complicate things.

Good software is possible. It's just not the default.

## What you can do

**Recognize it's not you.** When software is frustrating, the frustration is valid. It's not a skill issue - it's a design issue.

**Look for command palettes.** Ctrl+K or Cmd+Shift+P in many apps opens a searchable list of everything the app can do. It's the closest thing to "just tell me what's possible."

**Notice when software respects you.** When something feels good to use, that's not accident. Someone made choices. Reward those choices with your attention.

**Accept that expertise is contextual.** Being good at one app doesn't transfer. Each app has its own arbitrary hiding places. You're not dumb for not knowing them - you just haven't memorized that particular maze yet.

## The deeper problem

Software is hard because the people building it benefit from it being hard, or don't prioritize it being easy, or simply don't know how to make it easier.

This isn't inevitable. Different incentives produce different software. The tools that feel good to use prove it's possible. The question is why they're the exception rather than the rule.

The answer is complicated - economics, history, culture, technical constraints. But it starts with recognizing: the difficulty is real, it has causes, and it could be otherwise.
