# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the PROJECT_NAME repository.

## Project Overview

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

<!-- Project-specific architecture notes -->

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

## Core Rules

- **Note things down immediately:** problems, tech debt, or issues spotted MUST be added to TODO.md backlog
- **Do the work properly.** Don't leave workarounds or hacks undocumented.

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** HashMap > inventory crate. OnceLock > lazy_static. Functions > traits until you need the trait. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment
